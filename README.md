Main objective of this study is to compare conventional U-Net with MCU-Net the proposed method, and using statistical inference to investigate if the proposed method performs better in terms of dice coefficient score.

stats.ipynb - Jupyter notebook file containing python scripts necessary for the statistcal analysis  
unet_pilot.csv - Pilot study data for U-Net architecture  
mcunet_pilot.csv - Pilot study data for MCU-Net architecture (proposed)  
unet.csv - Real study data after following the estimated sample size for U-Net  
mcunet.csv - Real study data after following the estimated sample size for MCU-Net  
.png - QQ plot images and Histogram images for normality test both on pilot and real study, the notebook also contains them
